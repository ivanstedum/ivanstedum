         <p>- A Film & Digital Media Production major turned Software Engineer after discovering a love
           of programming from creating my own games. 
           <br/>
           I am a graduate of Ada Developers Academy, a program
           for women and non-binary individuals to become Software Engineers. 
           <br/>
           I love gardening, science, and 
           driving hours away to find the perfect movie theatre. Invested in creating technology for the                social good and currently looking for Junior Software Engineer roles!
